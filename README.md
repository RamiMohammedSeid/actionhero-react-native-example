1) run `./bin/generateLib` to generate the client Primus Library we'll be using in our React Native Client.
2) Explore `./components/client` to see the (almost) 1-for-1 port of actionHeroClient JS library (which is generated by the actionhero server for browser clients from [this](https://github.com/actionhero/actionhero/blob/master/client/actionheroClient.js) template)

run the example (`npm run ios`)!
